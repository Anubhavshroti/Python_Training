    "# Q1. Case Study: Online Shopping Cart Exception Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "You are working as a Python developer for an e-commerce company, and your team is responsible for building and maintaining the shopping cart module of the website. Customers can add items to their cart, view the cart contents, and proceed to checkout.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, there have been reports of unexpected crashes and errors when customers interact with their shopping carts. Your task is to investigate these issues and improve the exception handling in the shopping cart code to make it more robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements and Scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario 1 - Adding Items to Cart:\n",
    "\n",
    "When a customer adds an item to their cart, they provide the product ID and quantity. Handle exceptions that may occur during this process, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Product ID not found in the product catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Invalid quantity (e.g., negative quantity or non-integer input).\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario 2-Viewing Cart Contents:\n",
    "\n",
    "When a customer views their cart, display the list of items and their quantities. Handle exceptions that may occur during this process, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Empty cart (no items added).\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Unexpected errors (e.g., network issues when fetching cart data).\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario 3- Proceeding to Checkout:\n",
    "\n",
    "When a customer proceeds to checkout, validate the cart and process the payment. Handle exceptions that may occur during this process, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Insufficient stock for some items in the cart.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Payment gateway errors..\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Customer payment method declined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Review the existing shopping cart code to identify potential areas where exceptions may occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Enhance the exception handling in the code by adding appropriate try, except, and finally blocks to handle exceptions gracefully. Provide helpful error messages to the user where applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Ensure that the program continues to run smoothly even when exceptions occur, and customers receive informative feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Test the shopping cart thoroughly with different scenarios to ensure that it handles exceptions correctly."
